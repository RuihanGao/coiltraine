On Offline Evaluation of Vision-based Driving Models
====================================================

Make a tutorial that should get again the full plot used
on ECCV.

The evaluation proposed on the paper comprises
using a a validation dataset toguether with some benhcmark


To re run the trainings

Not there are non determins on the training and evaluation, this
makes that the plots wont be the same


To download all the checkpoints run


#### Plotting


To run the plotting

    python3 plotting.







TODO: Maybe make an separate repository just for that.

List of experiments:
You should send a folder, with a set of experiments that are
going to be ploted.

Data params

Basically what kind of data is going to be used for plotting.
you can select the experiments that are going to be plotted.
