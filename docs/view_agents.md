Sample Agents
============


Here we show some sample conditional imitation learning
agents driving on the CARLA towns.


Getting Started
-------------


[Install the system](../README.md/#installation) and set the environment.

You can download the pytorch checkpoints by running the following script:

    python3 tools/download_sample_models.py

The checkpoints should now be allocated already on the proper folders.

Make sure you have the python path for the CARLA egg set:

     export PYTHON_PATH=<Path-To-CARLA-93>/PythonAPI/carla-0.9.3-py3.5-linux-x86_64.egg


### Town03 Agent


#### Inference

First have a CARLA 0.93 executing at some terminal at 40 fps (Recommend)

    sh CarlaUE4.sh Town03 -windowed -world-port=2000  -benchmark -fps=40
 

To run the and visualize the model run:

    python3 view_model.py  -f town03 -e resnet34imnet -cp 100000 -cv 0.9


You will see on the botton corner the activations of resnet intermediate
layers. You can control the agent actions by using the keyboard arrows.


#### Training


Download the dataset

You can learn how to use the framework on the following the [main tutorial](../README.md)
However to do a single train of the model for town03 using the
sample data:

    python3 coiltraine.py --single-process train -e resnet34imnet4 --folder town03 --gpus 0

To check images and train curves there is also a tensorboard log
being saved.






Town01/2 Agent
--------------

This agent is much more powerfull since it had much more
time for development, but if follows the same principle as the
agent for town03. Town03 is more complicated and probably
require
